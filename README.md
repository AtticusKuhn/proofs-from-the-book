# About
I am writing up all proofs given in the textbook
"proofs from THE BOOK" by Aigner and Ziegler in the
proof assistant Lean to check if the proofs are logically correct. If you want to see my current progress, go to

# Proofs From the Book

The mathematician Paul Erd≈ës said "The Book" is where God keeps the most elegant proof of each mathematical theorem.

# Lean
Lean is a formal theorem prover that checks that all proofs are logically consistent
